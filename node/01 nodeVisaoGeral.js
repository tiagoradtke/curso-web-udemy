LIBUV
libuv (Unicorn Velociraptor Library[2]) is a multi-platform C library that provides support for asynchronous I/O based on event loops. 
It supports epoll(4), kqueue(2), Windows IOCP, and Solaris event ports. It is primarily designed for use in Node.js but it is also used by other software projects.[3]]
It was originally an abstraction around libev or Microsoft IOCP, as libev doesn't support Windows. In node-v0.9.0's version of libuv, the dependency on libev was removed.[4]
